# AI Session Handoff

## Current State
* **Last Updated:** 2025-11-29
* **Status:** Complete
* **Context:** Created CLAUDE.md documentation for Claude Code to understand the codebase.

## Recent Accomplishments
* [x] Established AI Command Structure
* [x] Created Handoff file
* [x] Analyzed full codebase architecture
* [x] Created comprehensive CLAUDE.md file with:
  - Build commands (dotnet build/publish)
  - Project structure (Functions app + Flattener library)
  - Key architecture components and data flow
  - Configuration requirements and environment variables
  - Deployment instructions (PowerShell + Bicep)
  - Multi-tenant support documentation

## NEXT STEPS (Resume Work Here)
1. [ ] Review CLAUDE.md for any additional details needed based on actual development work
2. [ ] Consider adding testing documentation once test projects are created (none exist currently)
3. [ ] Add local development setup instructions if needed (local.settings.json template, Azure resources needed)
4. [ ] Document any specific debugging workflows for Azure Functions
5. [ ] If modifying the Flattener, document the JSON path configuration format used in `IKustoCallRecordHelpers`
